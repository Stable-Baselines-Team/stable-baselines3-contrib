class RecurrentActorCriticPolicy(ActorCriticPolicy):
    """
    Recurrent policy class for actor-critic algorithms (has both policy and value prediction).
    To be used with A2C, PPO and the likes.
    It assumes that both the actor and the critic LSTM
    have the same architecture.

    :param observation_space: Observation space
    :param action_space: Action space
    :param lr_schedule: Learning rate schedule (could be constant)

    :param activation_fn: Activation function
    :param ortho_init: Whether to use or not orthogonal initialization
    :param use_sde: Whether to use State Dependent Exploration or not
    :param log_std_init: Initial value for the log standard deviation
    :param full_std: Whether to use (n_features x n_actions) parameters
        for the std instead of only (n_features,) when using gSDE
    :param use_expln: Use ``expln()`` function instead of ``exp()`` to ensure
        a positive standard deviation (cf paper). It allows to keep variance
        above zero and prevent it from growing too fast. In practice, ``exp()`` is usually enough.
    :param squash_output: Whether to squash the output using a tanh function,
        this allows to ensure boundaries when using gSDE.
    :param features_extractor_class: Features extractor to use.
    :param features_extractor_kwargs: Keyword arguments
        to pass to the features extractor.
    :param share_features_extractor: If True, the features extractor is shared between the policy and value networks.
    :param normalize_images: Whether to normalize images or not,
         dividing by 255.0 (True by default)
    :param optimizer_class: The optimizer to use,
        ``th.optim.Adam`` by default
    :param optimizer_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments,
        excluding the learning rate, to pass to the optimizer
    :param lstm_hidden_size: Number of hidden units for each LSTM layer.
    :param n_lstm_layers: Number of LSTM layers.
    :param shared_lstm: Whether the LSTM is shared between the actor and the critic
        (in that case, only the actor gradient is used)
        By default, the actor and the critic have two separate LSTM.
    :param enable_critic_lstm: Use a seperate LSTM for the critic.
    :param lstm_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass the the LSTM
        constructor.

        a positive standard deviation (cf paper). It allows to keep variance
        above zero and prevent it from growing too fast. In practice, ``exp()`` is usually enough.
    :param squash_output: Whether to squash the output using a tanh function,
        this allows to ensure boundaries when using gSDE.
    :param features_extractor_class: Features extractor to use.
    :param features_extractor_kwargs: Keyword arguments
        to pass to the features extractor.
    :param share_features_extractor: If True, the features extractor is shared between the policy and value networks.
    :param normalize_images: Whether to normalize images or not,
         dividing by 255.0 (True by default)
    :param optimizer_class: The optimizer to use,
        ``th.optim.Adam`` by default
    :param optimizer_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments,
        excluding the learning rate, to pass to the optimizer
    :param lstm_hidden_size: Number of hidden units for each LSTM layer.
    :param n_lstm_layers: Number of LSTM layers.
    :param shared_lstm: Whether the LSTM is shared between the actor and the critic.
        By default, only the actor has a recurrent network.
    :param enable_critic_lstm: Use a seperate LSTM for the critic.
    :param lstm_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass the the LSTM
        constructor.
