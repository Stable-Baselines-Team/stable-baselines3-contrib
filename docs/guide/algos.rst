RL Algorithms
=============

This table displays the rl algorithms that are implemented in the Stable Baselines3 contrib project,
along with some useful characteristics: support for discrete/continuous actions, multiprocessing.

.. note::
  ``Tuple`` observation spaces are not supported by any environment,
  however, single-level ``Dict`` spaces are

Actions ``gym.spaces``:

-  ``Box``: A N-dimensional box that contains every point in the action
   space.
-  ``Discrete``: A list of possible actions, where each timestep only
   one of the actions can be used.
-  ``MultiDiscrete``: A list of possible actions, where each timestep only one action of each discrete set can be used.
- ``MultiBinary``: A list of possible actions, where each timestep any of the actions can be used in any combination.
